      <h2>Internet Carpentry, part 2: Data Spelunking.</h2>
      <h1>Designing with APIs</h1>
      <p>We must understand the data material in order to organize, structure and present it in a context to a user in a meaningful way. In order to understand data we must dive in, explore and research it. Different ways of making the data available and ways of manipulating it can yield different uses and meanings.</p>
      <p>Your task this week is to explore and experiment with a given API. Your output will be in the form of an ambient display, making use of left over devices (such as an old smartphone or tablet). The device will be stationary and you need to decide in what location / situation the device will be located, and design your the output accordingly. The user group and context can be be very narrow. Your concept doesnâ€™t need to be universally relevant, efficient, nor aimed at problem solving. </p>
      <p>You will have to explore and investigate the data you choose in order to develop new and relevant uses of it. The goal is to make an interesting, pretty and delightful ambient display; Converting data into information, in a thoughtful and imaginative way.</p>
      <p>This is a individual task, but discussion and sharing is encouraged.</p>

      <h3>Recommended data sources (list of APIs)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.nrk.no/rss">NRK</a> (XML) | <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/feeds">The Guardian</a> (XML)</li>
        <li><a href="http://reisapi.ruter.no/help">Ruter</a> (json)</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.oslobysykkel.no/api">Oslo City Bike</a> (json)</li>
        <li><a href="http://om.yr.no/verdata/xml/">YR</a> (XML) | <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs">Weather Underground</a> (json) </li>
        <li><a href="https://api.nasa.gov/index.html">NASA</a> (json) </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Other? Then find at least one other student with the same source.</p>

      <h3>Considerations</h3>
      <p>This is a abstract and difficult task, here are some pointers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work with a reversed design process, the material is the starting point</li>
        <li>Don't expect concepts to reveal themselves. Grab your miner's hat and start data spelunking! </li>
        <li>Crossing different sources, sets and/ or services can create interestingness</li>
        <li>But... A single data point can be more than enough</li>
        <li>Think about sources, triggers, thresholds, loops, modes, feedback, rules, flux (time & amount), and experience over [what?] time</li>
        <li>Focus on the consumption of your data. Not so much the user's direct interaction with the interface. </li>
        <li>Not necessarily useful but meaningful</li>
        <li>Adapt scope to technical skills</li>
      </ul>
