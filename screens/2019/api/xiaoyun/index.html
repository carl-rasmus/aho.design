    <h1 class="with_studentname">Bus transfer experience</h1>

    <p class="copy">Sometimes we need to take more than one bus/tram to get to our destination. When we schedule to catch the first bus/tram, we are not sure if we could catch the earliest next bus. <br><br>
    This is designed for the bus transfer experience, by visualizing the remaining time for the next bus to allow users check the remaining time on the bus/ during waiting at the bus stop, so that they could schedule themselves to arrive on time. One block represent one minute, when the time pass, the blocks with fade out one by one, and users could see that the bus is leaving or not. They can walk faster/slower or buy a cup of coffee on the way to the next bus.</p>
