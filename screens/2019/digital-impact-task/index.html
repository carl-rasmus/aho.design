      <h2>Intent, Implementation and Consequences</h2>
      <h1>Digital Impact</h1>
      <p>2 week project: 18.03 - 29.03
      <br>
      <b>Work in groups of 2</b></p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>It is important to reflect on our responsibility when designing products and services.
        <br>
        This module aims to enhance your ability in predicting different types of use and abuse of your designs, and foresee further potential consequences that might arise.</p>

      <h3>The task</h3>
      <p><b>Design an interface and its interactions for a story, taking place in a near future. Use the interface as a driver in a short film.</b></p>

      <p>The starting point of you work will be either
        <br>
        a) an <b>emerging technology</b>
        <br><br>
        or
        <br><br>
        b) a technology instigated <b>user behavior</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Examples of emerging technologies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine learning</li>
        <ul>
          <li>New data analysis (audio, images and video)</li>
          <li>Automation</li>
          <li>Rule based evolution (e.g. ‘AlphaGo’)</li>
          <li>Human impersonation</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Blockchain and cryptocurrency</li>
        <li>Augmented reality</li>
        <li>Encryption</li>
        <li>‘Behavior diagnostics’</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Examples of user behavior</h4>
        <li>Selfies</li>
        <li>Shaming / up-skirting / trolling / online harrasment</li>
        <li>Sousveillance (cameras and microphones in every inch of our society)</li>
        <li>Online dating</li>
        <li>Private fundraising (e.g. GoFundMe)</li>
        <li>Attention diversion</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Context for your project</h3>
      <h4>Existing or new infrastructure</h4>
      <p>Invent a new, or piggyback an existing, software that encompass your concept – emotionally, socially, economically, or other. The software will have a UI that you will design the relevant parts of.</p>
      <h4>Timeframes: What future?</h4>
      <p>It could be tomorrow or next week, as an alternative present. Or, it might play out further into the near future, and even have a timeline that spans over multiple years. Don’t make any projections beyond year 2022.</p>
      <h4>Users and usage</h4>
      <p>Design not only for primary users but also regarding non-users, group dynamics, and the society as a whole. <br>
        Don’t develop the regular user scenarios where a single user uses a product and get super happy. Choose stress cases that shows where the edges of your project go. It can support ‘so and so’ - but not beyond this point etc.
      </p>
      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>Depending on your chosen project be resourceful in how you choose to study your topic.</p>
      <h4>Concept development (suggestions)</h4>
      <p>Discussions, paper prototyping, clickable’s, wireframes, video sketching, evidencing. </p>
      <h4>Filmmaking</h4>
      <p>Storytelling, mood setting, camera usage, editing, pace, framing, animation, timing.</p>

      <h3>Deliveries</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A short film portraying your concept</li>
        <li>Short description of your concept (max 280 characters)</li>
        <li>‘Killer image’</li>
        <li>Oral presentation. <br>
        Start by showing your short, then dissect and explain relevant thoughts, process and choices.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Tips & considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It doesn’t have to be dystopic. You can very well choose to make a net zero outcome, or even make a better world (latter is often harder).</li>
        <li>If your starting point is technology, research technologies that are approachable and not presented as ‘magical black boxes’.</li>
        <li>If your starting point is ‘behavior’, study behaviors that has developed from some of our ‘relatively new technologies’, like specific online behavior, or behavior ‘IRL’ (i.e. related to mobile usage).</li>
        <li>Foresee stress cases: Malintent, misuage, accidental usage, bad implementation, very different users - or adoption of, the same software.</li>
        <li>Don’t focus on device(s). Hardware is not interesting in this task.</li>
        <li>Reflect on the normative. (Like a stand-up comedian’s “What’s this thing with […]”)</li>
        <li>Be efficient when producing, only design and include the relevant bits of the picture. </li>
        <li>Acting is an art; So be creative to circumvent it. Focus on context and usage. There don’t need to be much of a ‘plot line’ to communicate a project – poor acting or poor plot lines distracts the quality of your concept.</li>
        <li>The scope of the implications shouldn’t necessarily be on a macro level (e.g. disrupting democracy). </li>
        <li>The pendulum swings back and forth:
          <br>Technology developed for new behaviors / Behaviors developed from new technology
          <br>Public / Private
          <br>Inner motivation / Gamification
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Evaluation</h3>
      <h4>Research and insight</h4>
      <p>The ability to be creative and resourceful in how you study behavior or emerging technology</p>
      <h4>Concept development</h4>
      <p>Your ability to drive a strong concept development process. For there to be a good story to tell, there need to be a strong concept.</p>
      <h4>Storytelling</h4>
      <p>The ability to communicate your project.</p>
